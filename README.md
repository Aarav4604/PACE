## ðŸš€ Quick Start for Developers (iOS)

After pulling from main, you can set up and run the iOS app with a single command:

```sh
cd apps/mobile
# If you use yarn:
yarn dev:ios
# Or with npm:
npm run dev:ios
```

This will:
- Install all JS dependencies
- Run CocoaPods install for iOS native modules
- Launch the iOS app in the simulator

No manual setup or extra steps required. Just pull and run!
